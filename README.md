## What is AppData.json and what is it used for?
[AppData.json](src/AppData.json) is a file used by the [SwedbankJson client API](https://github.com/walle89/SwedbankJson) project to automatically download the latest Swedbank mobile app meta data.
This data is used in the authentication process with the Swedbank mobile app API. More information can be found in the [SwedbankJson documentation](https://github.com/walle89/SwedbankJson/blob/master/docs/appdata.md).
